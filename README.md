# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Group-8

## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. This project aims to develop a deep learning model for breast cancer detection using histopathology images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify breast tissue samples as benign or malignant.
